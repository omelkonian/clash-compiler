# `clash-term` - Inspection mechanism for optimizations in the CÎ»aSH compiler

Terminal-based interactive UI, where you replay the optimization performed
by a previous run of the normalization phase.

The implementation is based on the `rewrite-inspector` library, available on [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/rewrite-inspector).
For detailed documentation and example visualizations, see the following [README](https://github.com/omelkonian/rewrite-inspector/blob/master/README.md).
